# community-forum

Members of our community are working to build an on-chain Community Forum so that Saito (and other blockchain projects) have a place to connect, engage and manage development plans. This team could use help from anyone with HTML / JS / CSS experience

We are currently looking for volunteers who would like to help build this community forum (Developers, designers (UX and UI), testers, project managers). 

For feature requests and suggestions, please create a ticket with the description on this kanban board: https://github.com/SaitoTech/community-forum/projects/1. 

Status: Ideation

Application: https://cforum.saito.io/post

**For Developers**

To setup your workspace locally and setup a node, kindly view this tutorial in wiki: https://wiki.saito.io/tech/installation

You may also directly contribute a feature change by requesting a pull request and adding a card on the project kanban board (https://github.com/SaitoTech/community-forum/projects/1). The team will review your changes and if it's worth publishing, we'll approve the request, else you'll receive an explanation from us on the same github card if it's rejected.

--- 

**note**: when using the kanban board, please always convert the card to an issue.
