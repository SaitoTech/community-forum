This is an implement of HERE I STAND written for the open source Saito Game Engine. The game supports both the two-player and six-player game variant rules.

As a fan of GMT Games and Here I Stand, our hope is that this module helps introduce new players to the company and the game, supports the community, and encourages the emergence of improved ecosystems for online gaming which will give games publishers more freedom to license their games for direct play on a game-by-game basis if they wish. We strive to make this game as standards-compliant as possible.

Please see the /licence directory for details on legalese. The short version is that the code that implements the game rules is released under the MIT license for all uses atop the Saito Game Engine. All GMT-developed materials (board design, cards, gameplay text) remain owned by GMT Games and are distributed under their own license, which provides for gameplay and distribution under the following conditions:

	1. The game files may only be used by open source, non-commercial game engines

	2. At least ONE player in every game should have purchased a commercial copy of the game.

If you are a player or developer who enjoys playing around with this implementation, please respect the goodwill shown by GMT Games and purchase a copy of the game. Likewise, if you make this demo available for play on a public server, please make sure that any players you support can fulfill these conditions by making it easy for them to purchase commercial copies of the game.
